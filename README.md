A Tactical Perspective
Real Madrid mightâ€‚bully Arsenalâ€™s flanks early, leading 4-2-4. Valverde and Modric will try for midfield dominance, while MbappÃ© and VinÃ­cius will searchâ€‚for the occasional counterattack. It will be physicalâ€‚and high pressing.
Arsenal counter, more often than not, through Saka and Martinelli, after absorbingâ€‚pressure and looking solid defensively. The set pieces are still a vital weapon, but Rice and parleyâ€‚tucked in front.
Crucial Information
Realâ€‚Madrid has never netted against Arsenal in European play.
No teamâ€‚has ever lost a knockout phase match in the Champions League by three goals and overturned the result in a round of 16 tie: no one, that is, except Real Madrid.

Full Time Result: Arsenal 7/2, Realâ€‚Madrid 7/10, Draw 3/1.
Weâ€™ve seen the late-game heroics that Real Madrid can be capable of at the BernabÃ©u, so this one isnâ€™t over yet, notâ€‚until the final whistle blows. Which team,â€‚in theory, is meant to advance? Arsenal.
At least Arsenal can return home with a more respectable three-nil aggregate,â€‚with the rematch set for the BernabÃ©u. Realâ€‚Madrid will require a monumental comeback to make it to the last four, with many of its stars left behind. And now Arsenal,â€‚resolute and unbowed in Europe, is headed for a Champions League final, a much more exotic destination
