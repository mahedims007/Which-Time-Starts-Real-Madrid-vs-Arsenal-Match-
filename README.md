A Tactical Perspective
Real Madrid might bully Arsenal’s flanks early, leading 4-2-4. Valverde and Modric will try for midfield dominance, while Mbappé and Vinícius will search for the occasional counterattack. It will be physical and high pressing.
Arsenal counter, more often than not, through Saka and Martinelli, after absorbing pressure and looking solid defensively. The set pieces are still a vital weapon, but Rice and parley tucked in front.
Crucial Information

Full Time Result: Arsenal 7/2, Real Madrid 7/10, Draw 3/1.
We’ve seen the late-game heroics that Real Madrid can be capable of at the Bernabéu, so this one isn’t over yet, not until the final whistle blows. Which team, in theory, is meant to advance? Arsenal.
At least Arsenal can return home with a more respectable three-nil aggregate, with the rematch set for the Bernabéu. Real Madrid will require a monumental comeback to make it to the last four, with many of its stars left behind. And now Arsenal, resolute and unbowed in Europe, is headed for a Champions League final, a much more exotic destination
